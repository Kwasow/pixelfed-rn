# Development

The pixelfed mobile app is written in [react native](https://reactnative.dev) and builds on the [expo framework](https://expo.dev).

## Requirements

- [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.com)
- [`yarn` package manager](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install)
- Building for android:
    - [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and java
- Building for iOS:
    - [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/ helps you to install most of the dependencies except for `git-lfs`.

## First time setup

```sh
corepack enable   # prerequisite to install yarn automatically on next step
yarn              # install dependencies
```

Also follow steps in https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/

## Build the project

```sh
yarn start
```

### Web

```sh
yarn web
```

### Android

```sh
yarn android
```

### iOS

```sh
yarn ios
```

### check for ts errors and lint problems
```sh
yarn check
```

### fix formatting & linting
```sh
yarn lint
```

## Troubleshooting

### node not fount
If iOS build complains about not being able to find `node`, but you can use node just fine, then run:
```
echo export NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node) > ios/.xcode.env.local
```

### missing .mm file in pods
when you get an error like this one:
```
error: Build input file cannot be found: '/Users/me/Coding/pixelfed/pixelfed-rn/node_modules/react-native/React/Fabric/RCTThirdPartyFabricComponentsProvider.mm'. Did you forget to declare this file as an output of a script phase or custom build rule which produces it? (in target 'React-RCTFabric' from project 'Pods')
```
then you might be able to fix it by:
```sh
cd ios
pod install
```
